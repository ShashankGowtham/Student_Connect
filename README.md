Got it! Here's a **well-formatted README written in simple English**, using paragraphs instead of bullet points but still organized clearly:

**Student Connect** is a complete web application designed to help colleges manage academic activities for students, teachers, and administrators. The goal is to bring everything ‚Äî attendance, assignments, schedules, exams, and resources ‚Äî into one easy-to-use platform.

For **Admins**, the system allows you to create student and teacher accounts, set up classrooms, assign class teachers, link subjects to classes, and manage everything from schedules to hall ticket releases. You can also post notices and monitor complaints, making administration much more organized and efficient.

**Teachers** can mark student attendance, view their schedules, and respond to complaints. They can also create assignments and quizzes for their classes, upload subject-related study material like PDFs and videos, and enter marks for exams. While the exams are conducted offline, this system helps store and view marks in a clear and structured way.

**Students** can use Student Connect to check their attendance, view exam marks and assignment grades, give quizzes, access their class schedules, download hall tickets, and study from the resources uploaded by teachers. Every student has their own dashboard showing key academic details like attendance and grades.

The project is built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express.js** for the backend. **MongoDB** is used as the database, managed through **Mongoose**. The application uses **JWT** for secure login, **Bcrypt** for password encryption, and includes tools like **Multer** for file uploads and **PDFKit** to generate PDF hall tickets.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashankGowtham/Student_Connect.git
cd Student_Connect
```

Next, install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Now, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

After setting this up, start the development server using:

```bash
npm start
```

Or if you're using **Nodemon** for automatic restarts during development, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, you can access the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5000` or similar, depending on your setup).
